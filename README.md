The Toxic Comment Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying and categorizing toxic comments in online conversations. With the increasing prevalence of online platforms for communication, the issue of toxic behavior, such as harassment, hate speech, and trolling, has become a significant concern. Automated systems capable of detecting and filtering out toxic comments can help maintain healthier online communities and protect users from harmful interactions.
